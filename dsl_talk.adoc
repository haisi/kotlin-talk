= Writing expressive domain specific languages in Kotlin
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Goals

* Benefits of Domain Specific Languages (DSL)
* Leverage advanced Kotlin language features to build DSLs

[.notes]
--
* The goals of today's talk are:
** learn in an abstract sense what a DSL is with its benefits
** and how one can use Kotlin to model DSL.
** Implicitly, we will familiarize ourselves with intermediate to advanced kotlin features such as:
*** operator overloading
*** type-safe builders
*** higher-order functions
*** receiver types
*** context-receivers
--


== Why DSL?

* Increases expressiveness of code
* Reduces problem space
* Increase discoverability
* => Reduces barriers of entry for domain experts

[.notes]

* General purpose languages by design allow you to express and thus solve essentially any problem
* However, using the lowest common denominator to model your code has adverse effects readability and maintainability
* So by developing a small little language specific to our problem, i.e. a *DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE*
* we _increase_ the expressiveness of our code by using terms from our domain
* and by modelling only what our domain allows us to do we _reduce the problem space_
* Thus, we increase the discoverability of our domain's functionality.
* Lastly, a DSL can be judged by how easy it is for a domain expert to understand the code.
Ideally, code written in our DSL should read somewhat like prose text.

== Example

[source,kotlin,highlight='1|2..8|6|9|10..12|13']
----
basket {
    val canCheckout = totalBasketValue {
        isLessThan(minPurchaseAmount)
    }
    if (!canCheckout) {
        checkCheckoutIsDisabled()
        return@basket
    }
    items {
        first {
            incraseQuantityBy(5)
        }
        decreaseQuantityOf(last()) by 1
    }
}

* Let's see an example of a DSL
* Here I have one for writing complex E2E tests
* I've written something very similar to this during my time at migros online
* I wrote large parts of their new Android app
* and the End-2-End test-suite.
* I modelled every screen as an entry point to a DSL, which exposed the possible interactions a user or specifically a test ---
* meaning from a human perspective --- can do on a screen
* I call these entries point robots and was able to chain them to automate whole user-interaction through the app
* // models all interactions with the basket view
* // dynamically interact with unknown state &  // make possible assertions
* // exposes interactions with items in basket
* // // approach (a)
* // // approach (b)
* I can highly recommend this talk by Jake Wharton
* The lessons learned are applicable for integration test on all platforms
